                <p>Global warming is becoming more and more apparent as the years go by. Temperatures and sea levels
                    have been rising
                    and weather has been getting overall more extreme. These have started to have an effect on the
                    global economy as a
                    whole. Th agriculture sector of economics is greatly effected by climate change for example. As
                    temperatures rise
                    and change dramatically, this effects crops and crop rotation. Some crops that would normally be
                    planted in early
                    summer when things are still somewhat cool, now have much small and more unpredictable growth
                    windows, making crop
                    shortages much more abundant. These crop shortages can cause increases in the prices of some food
                    items. One example
                    is corn and soybeans, which are both used in a variety of products. If there were to be shortages in
                    these items,
                    the production of food that use things such as corn syrup and even animal feed will drop
                    dramatically. These crops
                    in particular are also used in the production of ethanol, used for gasoline.
                    The changes in weather can also have an affect on cities infrastructure. Just last year, Texas
                    experienced one of
                    the worst winter storms they had ever seen. Because of this storm, Texasâ€™s roads were almost
                    unusable, and the
                    majority of their power grid had completely shut down. This is just one example of how the
                    unpredictable changes in
                    weather caused by global warming can have extremely harmful effects on cities and their
                    infrastructure. As cities
                    take bigger and bigger hits, so to does their countries economy, and if big cities economies take
                    hits, so to does
                    their states. </p>
