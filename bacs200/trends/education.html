                <p>On education trend I’ve been hearing talked about a lot is the effect that the pandemic and online
                    learning has and is
                    going to have on the school system. Think this is an interesting thing to theorize about and it has
                    both ups and downs
                    in my eyes. The world itself has been shifting online slowly for the past decade or so. From email
                    now to online school,
                    the shift was coming no matter what. I think there’s a lot of good that can come from online
                    education and a lot of bad.</p>
                <h3>The Good</h3>
                <p>Online education helps to provide a lot of chances to learn for students that can’t always make it to
                    class or have a
                    busy schedule, this applies to both kids and adults. For instance, kids might sometimes be sick and
                    unable to make
                    it to school, causing them to miss important material. It’s possible in the future, it could become
                    a standard that
                    there’s always a virtual attendance option. As for adults, online school has always been a thing,
                    from bachelors to
                    masters, there’s often online colleges. With a shift in online education, these kinds of classes and
                    opportunities
                    might become refined and a very good option for some people. </p>
                <h3>The Bad</h3>
                <p>Online education isn’t for everyone an has its draw backs. I definitely takes a large portion of
                    social interaction
                    away from children who might need it, especially those in kindergarten and middle school. The
                    younger years of
                    school are just as much about learning how to be social as they are about getting an education. With
                    fully online
                    school, there’s just a portion of social interaction that is completely missing.</p>
