                One huge technology trend I see being important for the future is the idea of a “metaverse” and the
                development of VR.
                Recently Microsoft and Meta (previously Facebook) have been generating some buzz about the idea of a
                technology called
                metaverse. A metaverse is essentially a virtual and augmented reality-based space in which people can
                work, communicate,
                and or play games with each other in a virtual space using avatars. The idea of a virtual space has
                become more and more
                realistic as the prospect of virtual reality becomes more refined. Currently VR has reached a level
                where it is nearly
                wireless and is being applied to more than just video games. Initially metaverses were being realized
                through video
                games, with games such a VR chat being a strong example. In VR chat, you can choose or create an avatar
                that you then
                use to interact with others in a fully 3D virtual space. The game also utilizes proximity-based audio
                and voice chat so
                that communication feels even more lifelike. Meta and Microsoft have been applying similar aspects as VR
                chat to attempt
                to create their own metaverses. These companies’ idea, however, is to use it less as a game, and more as
                one large work
                space for people to come together in no matter where they are. I believe this is becoming increasingly
                important with
                the recent pandemic creating a rise in remote working and making face-to-face contact more difficult.
                With more
                developments in VR, I think it could be the next step towards bringing the work place to your home and
                creating a
                unified work space.
