                <p>Hi, my name is Simon Warga. I am currently a Business Major at UNC with an emphasis in Computer
                    Information Systems and
                    a minor in Economics.</p>
                <p>For my background, I have experience in retail and the food industry on top of my studies at UNC. In
                    those positions I
                    worked prepping food, unloading freight, and most importantly I worked with customers. At UNC Iâ€™ve
                    studied a variety of
                    things in my major and minor. I have experience in software and database coding including coding in
                    C#, Java, and SQL
                    (specifically Oracle SQL Server). I also have experience in networking and information security, and
                    I am currently
                    taking a course in web development. On top of my information systems studies, I also have knowledge
                    in most general
                    business fields like accounting, finance, and marketing which I really enjoy. With that, I also have
                    an interest in
                    economics, specifically micro and industrial economics.</p>
                <p>My five greatest skills, in no particular order:
                    1. Strong note taking skills
                    2. Communication skills (such as working with customers)
                    3. Good with most technology
                    4. Able to work just as well with a group as I can alone
                    5. Strong time management
                </p>
                <p>Finally, what is it that I could do for a company. First off, pulling straight from my skills, I have
                    a strong
                    confidence in my note taking and communication skills. Because of this, I think I would be able to
                    work well with
                    customers in helping to understand and identify their needs, or working with them to help solve a
                    problem. This extends
                    beyond the customer though, I feel I could work well with my colleagues to try and understand the
                    possible problems we
                    may need to solve or things we might need to create or develop. I also am always willing to learn.
                    Though I only have
                    experience in a select few coding languages and software, I am more than willing to learn anything
                    that is necessary for
                    the company and always enjoy learning new things.</p>
