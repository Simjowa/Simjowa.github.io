                <h3>Social Implications</h3>
                <p> We have already begun seeing social impacts coming from climate change. Things such as droughts and
                    rising temperatures have been causing water shortages and threats to peoples livelihoods. This
                    summer alone, Death Valley, California reached a temperature of 130 degrees F.<img
                        src="DeathValley.jpg" class="rounded" width=400 alt="DeathValley"> Breaking the previous
                    record it had set of 129 degrees last year, which was the highest temperature they had seen in over
                    90 years. </p>
                <p>These drastic changes in temperature can also swing the
                    other way, with extreme bouts of cold and snow. Last winter, Texas was hit with one of the worst
                    winter storms they had ever experienced. They were hit with some of the lowest recorded temperatures
                    the state had ever seen. It was because of this that most of their roads became completely unusable
                    and their infrastructure began to completely collapse, resulting in the state's power grid shutting
                    down causing mass power outages. </p>

            <div class="col-sm">
                <h3>Economic Implications</h3>
                <p>Climate change can affect the economy in a variety of different ways. Some major impacts are:
                <ul>
                    <li>Harsh temperatures affecting work environments and output</li>
                    <li>Adverse affects on the agricultural industry</li>
                    <li>Repair costs from damaged infrastructure and global clean up operations</li>
                    <li>Labor shortages due to harsh climate and working conditions</li>
                    <li>Increased flooding in coastal cities forcing extra investment in repair and prevention</li>

                </ul>
                <p>
                    Due to climate change, there have also been many research companies sprouting up that are dedicating
                    research towards finding green alternatives to some things. A lot of investment has been put into
                    renewable
                    energy for example. Solar panel and wind turbine technology have been becoming more and more
                    advanced as
                    the years go on due to increased investment in their research and development. Not to say that
                    climate
                    change is a good thing, but without it there likely wouldn't have been as much investment into
                    renewable
                    energy alternatives.

                <h3>Political Implications</h3>
                <p>Where we currently stand, public and political opinions are often very split on this subject. Some
                    people believe we need to combat climate change and focus on placing laws and regulations that help
                    combat it. Others believe that it is not a political priority and that there are other issues to
                    focus on. On top of this, there is often small groups of people who believe that climate change
                    isn't a problem at all, some of them going as far as to say that it doesn't exist.</p>
                <p> Governments around the world have put different climate change policies in the hopes of combating
                    some climate change. There are US policies such as The Clean Air Act, that focus on having states
                    reduce their greenhouse gas emissions. There are also global policies and treaties such as the Paris
                    Accords, that help to coordinate worldwide climate change efforts.

                <h3>Conclusion and My Opinion</h3>
            </div>
            <div class="card-body">
                <p>I have always believed that climate change is a huge problem that has been impacting us for a
                    long time. As we get further along in this problem, it becomes more and more evident the impact
                    that climate change is having on the world. Researchers have begun saying that we are at a big
                    turning point with climate change, and if we continue on our trajectory, we may never be able to
                    correct it. It's because of this, I think that we need to make combating climate change a
                    priority. Prioritizing it can have economic and social impacts for sure, but as we are seeing
                    now, if this continues the way it is it will impact the world in much worse ways. </p>
                <p>In the end, there is no much one person can change. I just hope that more people can come to
                    understand the severity of the threat we are facing. I also hope that people understand that,
                    though at sometimes it may not seem bad, it's not just about us but those around us and future
                    generations.</p>
